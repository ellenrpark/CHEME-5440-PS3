# CHEME-5440-PS3

## Part a
Used data from KEGG to construct a stoichiometric matrix S for the urea cycle. 
* See file XXX.xls or XXX.csv for stoichiometric matrix. S = [M x R] = [18,21]
* See file XXXX.pdf for reaction network. 
* Below is the key for that defines the different fluxes. 
    * Reaction fluxes:
          v1
          v2
          v3
          v4
          v5(+)
          v5(-)
    * Exchange fluxes

          b3
          b4
          b5
          b6
          b7
          b8
          b9
          b10
          b11
          b12
          b13
          b14(+)
          b14(-)

## Part b
Created an atom matrix A = [M x A] where A = C,H,N,N,P,S. See file: XXX.xls or XXX.csv for atom matrix

To determine if the urea cycle reconstruction is elementally balanced, calculate A^T*S
